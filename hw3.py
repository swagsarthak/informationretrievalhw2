# homework 4
# goal: ranked retrieval, PageRank, crawling
# exports:
#   student - a populated and instantiated cs547.Student object
#   PageRankIndex - a class which encapsulates the necessary logic for
#     indexing and searching a corpus of text documents and providing a
#     ranked result set

# ########################################
# first, create a student object

# our index class definition will hold all logic necessary to create and search
# an index created from a web directory
#
# NOTE - if you would like to subclass your original Index class from homework
# 1 or 2, feel free, but it's not required.  The grading criteria will be to
# call the index_url(...) and ranked_search(...) functions and to examine their
# output.  The index_url(...) function will also be examined to ensure you are
# building the index sanely.

        # necessary data members

    # purpose: crawl through a web directory of html files and generate an
    #   index of the contents
    # preconditions: none
    # returns: num of documents indexed
    # hint: use BeautifulSoup and urllib
    # parameters:
    #   url - a string containing a url to begin indexing at

    def tokenize(self, text):
        # ADD CODE HERE

        return []

    # ranked_search( text )
    # purpose: searches for the terms in "text" in our index and returns
    #   AND results for highest 10 ranked results
    # preconditions: .index_url(...) has been called on our corpus
    # returns: list of tuples of (url,PageRank) containing relevant
    #   search results

    #   text - a string of query terms
